Simple website using the framework Phoenix and the language Elixir. DES can edit, remove and update artists and musics that can be created by the user. This project was used as the Funcional Programming's class final project at the Federal University of Paraiba (UFPB), at the request of the professor Andrei Formiga, from the Scientific Computer Departament (DCC) of the Informatics Center (CI), UFPB.
